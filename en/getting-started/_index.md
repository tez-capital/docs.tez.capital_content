summary: Getting started with Tezos baking

Baking on Tezos refers to the act of validating and producing blocks on the Tezos blockchain. Baking is suited for individuals at home as well as companies in their on-premise data centers.

TezBake software focuses on individuals and companies baking on-premise in their homes and data centers. We support the most secure on-premise baking method which involves dedicating a small form factor computer with hardware wallet key storage. This setup is inexpensive, widely available, and very secure.

**Key Points:**
- No stake slashing for hardware failures (you only miss rewards during downtime)
- Blocks scheduled 2-3 days in advance
- Must be operational during scheduled block times
- Need 67% attestation success rate per cycle (every 2.8 days)
