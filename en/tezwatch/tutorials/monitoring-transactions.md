## How to monitor Tezos balances and transactions with TezWatch

Using TezWatch you can keep an eye on transactions to and from baker wallets or baker payment wallets with flexibility.

You can monitor some of the following aspects:
- Transfers in/out in amounts greater than X but less than Y
- Notify when balance falls below X

> If you want to remain anonymous, you can create a new Discord account and join our Discord server using that account. Then you can DM the TezWatch bot from that account and what with it in private.

To get all "sources" and "events" use the `/events` command

Here are the descriptions of all the key variables you will need to configure to monitor balances and transactions:
| Variable    | Available Options                          | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
