## Introduction

The Tezos Data Availability Layer (DAL) enhances network scalability by efficiently handling large volumes of data off-chain, providing essential support for rollups and other layer-2 solutions. This guide explains how to set up DAL locally alongside your TezBake baker.

For more details on DAL, see [Tezos DAL Overview](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/dal_overview.html).

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> The security implications for bakers in the DAL network are highlighted in the [official Octez documentation](https://octez.tezos.com/docs/shell/dal_overview.html). Since a baker’s bandwidth in the DAL is proportional to their stake, it may be relatively straightforward to identify the IP address of a DAL node—especially for bakers with substantial stakes.
>
> To mitigate this risk, the core team advises running your DAL node on a different IP address than your L1 node. This separation helps prevent unintentional exposure of your node’s identity.
>
> If you wish to run TezBake with DAL on a separate machine, consider using [TezBake Prism Tunneling](https://docs.tez.capital/tezbake/tutorials/baking-with-prism/), which is designed for setups across multiple hosts.

## New TezBake Setup with DAL

You can set up TezBake with DAL integration from scratch. Follow these steps:

1. **Run setup with DAL integration:**

```bash
tezbake setup --with-dal
```

2. Proceed with your usual setup steps (ledger integration, baker registration, etc.).

3. Continue to the [After Setup](#after-setup) section.

## Existing TezBake Setup

If you already have TezBake running without DAL, follow these steps:

1. **Install DAL:**

```bash
tezbake setup --dal
```

## After DAL Setup

1. **Inject attester profiles:**

This step does not require interaction with your Ledger:

```bash
tezbake update-dal-profiles --auto
```

If the above command fails, specify your **baker key** (not consensus key):

```bash
tezbake update-dal-profiles <your-baker-key>
```

2. **Restart TezBake to apply changes:**

```bash
tezbake stop && tezbake start
```

## Quick Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues or require immediate help, execute these commands to revert changes and reinstall:

```bash
tezbake remove --dal
tezbake setup --node  # choose 'yes' to merge config when prompted
tezbake stop && tezbake start
```

## Verify DAL Operation

Ensure your DAL process is correctly running by checking logs:

```bash
tezbake node log dal -f
```

Your logs should indicate the DAL is receiving block levels. Also, verify the TezBake baker logs are error-free regarding DAL integration:

```bash
tezbake node log baker -f
```

For additional DAL checks, refer to the [Nomadic Labs DAL Tutorial](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/dal_overview.html).
