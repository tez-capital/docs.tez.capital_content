title: "Baking with Peak GUI"
weight: 1
type: docs
summary: TezBake Baking Tutorial for GUI Users
---

## Preparation

For this tutorial, you'll need to have already followed one of the following tutorials:
* [How to Bake](/tezbake/tutorials/how-to-bake)
* [How to Bake on Ghostnet](/tezbake/tutorials/how-to-bake-ghostnet)

The TezPeak GUI is a graphical user interface for TezBake, which is a command-line tool for baking and endorsing Tezos blocks. It's a great way to get started with baking and endorsing without having to use the command line on a day-to-day basis.

> Please note that tezbake version 0.13.0-beta minimum is required to use TezPeak.

## Installation

TezPeak GUI supports using TezBake and TezPay simultaneously or by themselves. To run them at the same time simply combine both configurations in the same file as shown here: [https://github.com/tez-capital/tezpeak](https://github.com/tez-capital/tezpeak)

### Download and install TezPeak via TezBake

   ```
   tezbake setup --peak
   ```

### Setup TezPeak configuration

   ```
   cd /bake-buddy/peak/ && touch config.hjson
   ```

Open the `config.hjson` file with your favorite text editor.

> If you've used json before but now hjson, you can read more about it here: [https://hjson.github.io/](https://hjson.github.io/)

##### Sample TezPeak configuration with 1 baker

Here's an example of a `config.hjson` file with minimal TezBake configuration for one baker:

   ```
{
    listen: 0.0.0.0:8733
    app_root: /bake-buddy
    modules: {
        tezbake: {
            bakers: [
                tz1S5WxdZR5f9NzsPXhr7L9L1vrEb5spZFur
            ]
        }
    }
}
   ```

You can also make TezPeak GUI only available on the local computer if you have an all-in-one setup (i.e. the baker and the GUI are on the same computer which has a graphical user interface):

   ```
{
    listen: 127.0.0.1:8733
    app_root: /bake-buddy
    modules: {
        tezbake: {
            bakers: [
                tz1S5WxdZR5f9NzsPXhr7L9L1vrEb5spZFur
            ]
        }
    }
}
   ```

##### Full TezPeak configuration examples

Here's the TezPeak configuration with all TezBake available options:

   ```
{
	# Id to show in the header
    id: ""
	# Address to listen on
    listen: 127.0.0.1:8733
    app_root: /bake-buddy
    modules: {
        tezbake: {
			# uncomment bellow to disable tezbake package monitoring
            # applications: null
            bakers: [
				# list of bakers to monitor for balances and rights
                tz1P6WKJu2rcbxKiKRZHKQKmKrpC9TfW1AwM
            ]
        }
	# List of reference nodes to connect to
	# The reference nodes are used to get the rights and blocks if the baker's node is not available
    nodes: {
        "Tezos Foundation": {
            address: https://rpc.tzbeta.net/
            is_rights_provider: true
            is_block_provider: false
        }
        tzkt: {
            address: https://rpc.tzkt.io/mainnet/
            is_rights_provider: false
            is_block_provider: true
	        # reports error if node not available, use for baker's node
            is_essential: false
        }
    }
	# The mode tezpeak should operate in
	# auto - if bound to localhost, it will operate in private mode if not, it will operate in public mode
	# public - assumes public environment, only readonly operations are allowed
	# private - assumes private environment, all operations are allowed
    mode: auto
}
   ```

## Start TezPeak and connect to it

   ```
   tezbake start --peak
   ```

If you're connecting to the TezPeak GUI from a different computer, you'll need to open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-baker-ip>:8733`. 

If you're connecting from the same computer, you can use `http://127.0.0.1:8733` or `http://localhost:8733`.
