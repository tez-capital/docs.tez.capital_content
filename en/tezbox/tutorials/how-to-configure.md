## TezBox Configuration Options

### CI/CD Pipelines

TezBox is commonly used in CI pipelines. If you can estimate the expected duration of a specific test and want to prevent CI from getting stuck, you can use the `--timeout=<duration>` option to limit how long the instance runs. 
Supported units: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours). In case of a timeout, the container exits with an exit code of `2`.

> The timeout specifies how long the sandbox runs, excluding the bootstrap duration.

### Logs

Output from each service are stored in `/ascend/logs` within the container. To access the logs without entering the container, mount this directory from outside the container.

To mount the `/ascend/logs` directory from inside the container to your host system, use Docker's `-v` option to bind mount the directory when running the container. 

Hereâ€™s the command format:

   ```
   docker run -it -v /path/on/host:/ascend/logs --entrypoint tezbox ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```
For example:

   ```
   docker run -it -v /home/tezos/logs:/ascend/logs --entrypoint tezbox ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```

### Overrides and configuration through mounted volumes

You can override any configuration file by mounting your own file to the `/tezbox/overrides` directory. The file will be merged with the default configuration. If you want to replace the whole configuration or file without merging, you can mount it to the `/tezbox/configuration` directory. The configuration is merged with the overrides and the result is stored in the `/tezbox/context` directory during the initialization of the container. 

> Array values are always replaced, not concatenated.

For example if you want to adjust block times, you can create `sandbox-override-parameters.hjson` file with the following content:

   ```
   minimal_block_delay: "1" // minimal block delay in seconds, has to be quoted
   ```

Run the container with the following command:

   ```
   # sudo docker run -it -v <path-to-your-file>:/tezbox/overrides/protocols/<case sensitive protocol id>/sandbox-parameters.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   
   sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/sandbox-override-parameters.hjson:/tezbox/overrides/protocols/Proxford/sandbox-parameters.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```

You can determine path based on folder structure in https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbox/tree/main/configuration

Optionally you can mount entire overrides/configuration directory to `/tezbox/overrides` or `/tezbox/configuration` to replace the whole configuration.

   ```
   sudo docker run -it -v <path-to-your-configuration-overrides>:/tezbox/overrides ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```

> Do not edit or mount configuration files in the `/tezbox/context` directory. They are generated automatically and should not be modified manually.

### Accounts

By default tezbox comes with these accounts:

   ```
    {
        alice: {
            pkh: tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb
            pk: edpkvGfYw3LyB1UcCahKQk4rF2tvbMUk8GFiTuMjL75uGXrpvKXhjn
            sk: unencrypted:edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq
            balance: 2000000
        }
        bob: {
            pkh: tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6
            pk: edpkurPsQ8eUApnLUJ9ZPDvu98E8VNj4KtJa1aZr16Cr5ow5VHKnz4
            sk: unencrypted:edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt
            balance: 2000000
        }
    }
   ```

You can add modify as needed. Just mount your own file to `/tezbox/overrides/accounts.hjson` for override or `/tezbox/configuration/accounts.hjson` for full replacement.

### Services

You can adjust service behavior by mounting your own configuration to `/tezbox/overrides/services/...` for override or `/tezbox/configuration/services/...` for full replacement.

If you want to disable a service, you can create override with `autostart: false`. 

For example to disable baker service you would crease `baker.hjson` file:

   ```
   autostart: false
   ```

Mount it into overrides directory:

   ```
   sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/baker.hjson:/tezbox/overrides/services/baker.hjson ... ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```

### Chain Context

Chain and protocol is automatically initialized only once during the first run. The chain and all runtime data are stored in `/tezbox/context/data` directory. If you want to persist your sandbox state just run it with mounted volume to `/tezbox/context/data` directory.

   ```
   sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd)/sandbox-data:/tezbox -p 0.0.0.0:8732:8732 ghcr.io/tez-capital/tezbox:tezos-v20.3 parisbox
   ```

> To reset the state you can remove the `/tezbox/context/data/tezbox-initialized` file. After its removal all chain and client data will be removed and the chain will be reinitialized on the next run.

### Flextesa Compatibility

To maintain some level of compatibility with Flextesa, the `alice` and `bob` accounts are the same. The RPC port is exposed on ports 8732 and 20000. In addition, TezBox uses similar protocol aliases like `oxfordbox` and `parisbox`.

Unlike Flextesa, TezBox won't expose configuration through command line arguments. Instead you can edit the configuration directly in the configuration files or use overrides.

## Building TezBox

# To build TezBox follow these steps:

1. clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/tez-capital/tezbox && cd tezbox`
2. edit the Dockerfile, configuration and sources if needed
3. build lua sources (you can get eli from https://github.com/alis-is/eli/releases)
   `eli build/build.lua`
4. build the image
   `sudo docker build --build-arg="PROTOCOLS=PsParisC" --build-arg="IMAGE_TAG=octez-v20.3" -t tezbox . -f containers/tezos/Containerfile --no-cache`
