## What is Tezos Baking?

"Baking" is Tezos terminology for validating transactions and creating new blocks on the blockchain. The term comes from the process of "baking" new blocks into the chain.

Fundamentally, baking on Tezos involves 2 responsibilities:

1. **Block Production & Attestation** - Creating new blocks every 8 seconds and attesting (validating) blocks produced by other bakers. Bakers stake their tez (Tezos tokens) as collateral to participate. This staked tez acts as a security deposit - honest bakers earn rewards, while malicious behavior (like creating or validating invalid blocks) results in losing the staked tez through [slashing](/getting-started/slashing-explained/).

2. **Governance Participation** - Voting on protocol upgrade proposals that can modify any aspect of the Tezos protocol, including technical changes and funding allocations from the protocol treasury.
