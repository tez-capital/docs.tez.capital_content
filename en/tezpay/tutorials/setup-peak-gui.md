## Installation

TezPeak GUI supports using TezBake and TezPay simultaneously or by themselves. To run them at the same time simply combine both configurations in the same file as shown here: [https://github.com/tez-capital/tezpeak](https://github.com/tez-capital/tezpeak)

> Scroll down to the bottom of the page for the full configuration example.

### Download and install TezPeak via TezBake

   ```bash
   tezbake setup --peak
   ```

> You don't need to install the TezBake node or baker services to use TezPay.

### Setup TezPeak configuration

   ```bash
   cd /bake-buddy/peak/ && touch config.hjson
   ```

Open the `config.hjson` file with your favorite text editor. 

##### Sample TezPeak configuration

Here's an example of a minimal TezPeak `config.hjson` file with just TezPay configured:

   ```json
{
    listen: 0.0.0.0:8733
    app_root: /bake-buddy
    modules: {
        tezpay: {
            payout_wallet: tz1X7U9XxVz6NDxL4DSZhijME61PW45bYUJE
        }
    }
}
   ```

##### Full TezPeak configuration examples

Here's the TezPeak configuration with all available TezPay options:

   ```json
{
	# Id to show in the header
    id: ""
	# Address to listen on
    listen: 127.0.0.1:8733
    app_root: /bake-buddy
    modules: {
        tezpay: {
			# can be null to disable tezpay package monitoring
            applications: {
				# path to tezpay ami package, either absolute or relative to parent directory peak
                tezpay: tezpay
            }
            payout_wallet: tz1X7U9XxVz6NDxL4DSZhijME61PW45bYUJE
            payout_wallet_preferences: {
                balance_warning_threshold: 100
                balance_error_threshold: 50
            }
			# forces all operations to be dry run
            force_dry_run: true
        }
    }
	
	# List of reference nodes to connect to
	# The reference nodes are used to get the rights and blocks if the baker's node is not available
    nodes: {
        "Tezos Foundation": {
            address: https://rpc.tzbeta.net/
            is_rights_provider: true
            is_block_provider: false
        }
        tzkt: {
            address: https://rpc.tzkt.io/mainnet/
            is_rights_provider: false
            is_block_provider: true
	        # reports error if node not available, use for baker's node
            is_essential: false
        }
    }
	# The mode tezpeak should operate in
	# auto - if bound to localhost, it will operate in private mode if not, it will operate in public mode
	# public - assumes public environment, only readonly operations are allowed
	# private - assumes private environment, all operations are allowed
    mode: auto
}
   ```

## Start TezPeak and connect to it

   ```bash
   tezbake start --peak
   ```

If you're connecting to the TezPeak GUI from a different computer, you'll need to open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-baker-ip>:8733`. 

If you're connecting from the same computer, you can use `http://127.0.0.1:8733` or `http://localhost:8733`.
